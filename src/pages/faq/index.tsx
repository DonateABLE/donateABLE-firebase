                            The overall mission and purpose of donateABLE is to
                            give back to the local community. The project in
                            it's entirety was funded solely by Synergenics, for
                            all of the development and implementation of this
                            new technology. Going forward, 85% of all donated
                            CPU power will go directly to your charity of
                            choice. The remaining 15% will be kept back to help
                            fund infrastructure and management costs related to
                            running this endeavour.

                            The current digital currency being mined by this
                            project is an open source Cryptocurrency, founded in
                            April 2014, called MONERO (XMR). This specific
                            currency is being used due to the fact that it uses
                            the CryptoNight hash algorithms, which are geared to
                            work best with CPUâ€™s and are deliberately made to be
                            resilient towards ASIC mining to keep the currency
                            safer and available to the masses.

                            There could be a few different factors preventing
                            you from being able to donate. Certain browsers, pop
                            up blockers and anti virus packages have the
                            potential of stop the mining process from being
                            invoked. If you are not prompted with a pop up after
                            pressing the START button on your selected charity
                            to begin donating, you may need to add an exception
                            for the donateABLE website in any of those three
                            solutions. If adding the exception does not resolve
                            the issue, feel free to contact our support staff
                            from the Technical Support form on the Contact Us

                            Average computer tasks such as web browsing, word
                            processing, and YouTube use less than 30% CPU in
                            total. The rest of it is unused and can be put
                            towards donations. Feel free to experiment with the
                            amount of CPU you use to donate with, and to turn it
